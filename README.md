# passwordGenerator

Hello and welcome to my repo!

This is a simple password generator written in C#.
You can choose if you want lowercase or uppercase letters, numbers or symbols (or a mix of all 4). 
It's also possible to export a chosen number of passwords into a text file onto the desktop.

This little program was written on a rainy sunday just for fun and because it helps me learn C# and winforms.

It's a hobby project and just for learning purposes.
